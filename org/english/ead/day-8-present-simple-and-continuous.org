* Review The Verb To Be

  To be is the only irregular verb in present simple tense.

  + I *am* an irregular verb. 
  + You *are* forced to deal with it.
  + That *is* the way it *is*.
  + You *are* not alone.
  + They *are* happy to learn with me.

* Other Verbs
 For all the other verbs you just have to keep the infinitive without 'to', except
 for He/She/It where you need to add an 's' (except for modals but we'll dedicate a chapter on it just be patient). Let's see some examples.

* Examples
   1. I (to work) *work* every day, but my wife (to do) *does* not.
   2. He (to learn) *learns* English by himself and she (to study)
      *studies* it at University.
   3. I (to try) *try* to travel as much as I (to wish) *wish*.
   4. My daughter (to try) *tries* to make new sounds every day.
   5. Her mother (to cook) *cooks* very well and I (to like) *like*
      that.
* Exercise 1
   Complete the following sentences with the verb in parentheses using
   the present simple.
   1. Usually I (to eat) my breakfast at 7:00 am.
   2. She (to listen) to music while she (to do) her homework.
   3. You (to try) to do your exercises in each lesson.
   4. In NYC people in the street usually (to walk) fast.
   5. It (to make) sense to study every day if you (to want) to improve
      your level.

* Present Continuous Also Called Present Progressive

  The construction of the present continuous or present progressive is
  simple: to be + infinitive - to + ing

  Let's see some examples.

* Examples
   1. I (to go) *am going* to show you the present continuous.
   2. You (to read) *are reading* this sentence right now.
   3. My daughter (to play) *is playing* with her mother.
   4. My nephew (to finish) *is finishing* his video game.
   5. They (to live) *are living* in the information era with a lot of
      connected objects.
* Exercise 2
   Complete the following sentences with the verb in parentheses using
   the present continuous.
   1. I (to eat) my breakfast right now because it's 7:00 am.
   2. Currently, she (to listen) to music while she (to do) her homework.
   3. Right now, you (to try) to do this exercise in this lesson.
   4. While I (to walk) in the street I can observe people.
   5. After this I (to go) to explain to you when you should use one tense
      or the other.
* When To Use Which One
** Present Simple
*** General Truth, Habit, and so on
   The present simple expresses a general truth, a habit, a persistant
   fact.
**** Examples
    1. Women live longer than men.
    2. I try to express myself in the language of the country I live.
    3. I always like to learn new languages.
**** Exercise 3
    Write 3 sentences using the present simple.
*** Other Cases
    + Comments in live (on TV, radio,...)
    + Newspaper titles
    + Movie script
**** Examples
     1. Ronaldo dribbles the last defender and then he shoots and
        scores!
     2. Prime Minister visits new station.
     3. The detective appears at the door. He knocks. Lisa rises,
        pauses a moment. She crosses the room to open the door.
**** Exercise 4
     Write an example for each case.
** Present Continuous or Present Progressive 
   The present continuous expresses an action or a fact that is
   happening right now, currently, at the moment we talk about it.
*** Examples
    1. Be careful! Taxi cabs in London don't care about pedestrians.
    2. What are you doing? I am studying English.
*** Exercise 5 
    Write 2 examples using present continuous.
*** Verbs That Almost Never Use Present Continuous
    Some verbs describe the result rather the action itself.

    agree, believe, belong, consist, contain, depend, deserve, doubt,
    hate, include, know, like, love, matter, mean, need, own, possess,
    prefer, recognize, remember, seem, suppose, understand, want, wish
