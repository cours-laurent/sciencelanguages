#+TITLE: Days of the week
#+AUTHOR: Laurent Garnier

* Introduction
  + Laurent :: Hi Stacy!
  + Stacy :: Salut Laurent !
  + Laurent :: How are you today? You can't say "Monday" because
               today is Tuesday!
  + Stacy :: You're right! But, you know, as an American I'm positive
             every day, even Monday.
  + Laurent :: Yes, and that's one reason I like the American
               mindset. Let's dive into the lesson of the day: DAYS OF
               THE WEEK!

* Days of the week

  | Day | English   | Français |
  |-----+-----------+----------|
  |   1 | Monday    | lundi    |
  |   2 | Tuesday   | mardi    |
  |   3 | Wednesday | mercredi |
  |   4 | Thursday  | jeudi    |
  |   5 | Friday    | vendredi |
  |   6 | Saturday  | samedi   |
  |   7 | Sunday    | dimanche |

* Exercise 1
   1. What day of the week is it today?
   2. Write your routine for each day of the week. For example:
      + On Mondays, I buy groceries for the week. 
      + On Tuesdays, I go to the gym. 
      + And so on.
* Exercise 2
  In the [[https://github.com/lgsp/sciencelanguages/blob/master/org/english/ead/day-2-numbers.org][previous lesson]] we learned about numbers so let's do a quick quiz to see if you did indeed learn them:
  1. Write today's date.
  2. How many weeks are there in a year?
