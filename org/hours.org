   latin abbreviation in order to specify wether the time is in the
   morning or in the afternoon. 
*** Examples
    1. What time is it please? It's six p.m (post meridiem), 6:00 p.m
       (in the afternoon, and in this case in the evening depending to
       the season)
    2. What's the time please? It's quarter past four a.m (ante
       meridiem), 4:15 a.m (in the morning, and in this case in the
       night)
    3. What time is it please? It's half past three p.m (post
       meridiem), 3:30 p.m (in the afternoon)
    4. What's the time please? It's six to ten a.m (ante meridiem),
       9:54 a.m (in the morning)

   system without latin abbreviation.

   2. It's ten to five p.m. Express it just by describing the numbers
      without abbreviation.
* Noon and midnight
  There also a specific case for twelve. Indeed a day spend 24 hours,
  so 12 is the right middle. So before twelve, that's the morning and
  after twelve that's the afternoon, because 12:00 p.m is called noon.
  12:00 a.m is called midnight (middle of the night).
