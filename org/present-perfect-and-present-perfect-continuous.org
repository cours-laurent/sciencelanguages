         raining.
    + To express that an action has just been finished :: I'm tired
         because I've been working all the day. 
* Regular verbs
 For all the regular verbs you just have to keep the verbal base and
 to add 'ed' at the end in order to get the past participle. Let's see some examples.

** Examples
   1. I (to work) *have worked* for hours.
   2. He (to learn) *has learned* English since Middleschool.
   3. *Have* you ever (to try) *tried* to travel as much as possible for
      a month?
   4. What (to visit) *have* they *visited* since the beginning of
      your trip?
   5. Where (to travel) *have* you *traveled* for a month?
** Exercise 1
   Complete the following sentences with the verb in parenthesis using
   the present perfect simple.
   1. Have you (to plan) your trip?
   2. She (to listen) to the music for hours.
   3. Have they (to try) to do the exercises.
   4. We (to finish) to play since 7 p.m.
   5. They (to visit) India for a month.

* Irregular verbs
  In English there are a lot of irregular verbs. Because of that I've
  decided to do specific lessons on these verbs. So right now I will
  just show you some of them. Don't focus it currently. Be patient
  we'll study them carfully, later.

** Examples  
   1. Where (to go) *have* you *gone* since yesterday?
   2. We (to eat) *have eaten* some pizza.
   3. They (to come) *have come* back from their trip in the U.S.A for
      a month.
   4. How long (to make) *have* you *been making* this object?
   5. How many glasses (to drink) *have* you *drunk*?
** Exercise 2
   1. You (to be) really helpful today.
   2. We (to cut) some wood for hours.
   3. She (to eat) a pizza.
   4. How long you (to grow) your beard?
   5. I (to forget) my keys at the hotel.
