** Ordinal number
   Let's imagine you're talking about the rank of your favorite team:
   | Rank | English | Français                                      |
   |------+---------+-----------------------------------------------|
   |    1 | first   | premier                                       |
   |    2 | second  | deuxième (second s'il n'y a pas de troisième) |
   |    3 | third   | troisième                                     |
   |    4 | fourth  | quatrième                                     |
   |    5 | fifth   | cinquième                                     |
   |    6 | sixth   | sixième                                       |
   |    7 | seventh | septième                                      |
   |    8 | eighth  | huitième                                      |
   |    9 | ninth   | neuvième                                      |

   Do you see a patern? Just remember the first three by heart and
   then add "th" at the end. But be careful with five and nine.
