* The 1 to 12 System
   Traditionally, English speakers used the 1 to 12 system with two
   Latin abbreviations in order to specify whether the time is in the
   morning (am stands for ante meridian) or in the afternoon (pm stands for post meridian). 
* Examples
    1. What time is it please? It's six pm, 6:00 pm. 
       Note: You can also answer: It's six in the afternoon.
    2. What's the time please? It's four fifteen am, 4:15 am. 
       Note: You can also say: It's quarter past four in the morning.
    3. What time is it please? It's three thirty pm , 3:30 pm.
       Note: You can also answer: It's half past three in the afternoon.
    4. What's the time please? It's nine fifty-four am, 9:54 am.
       Note: You can also say: It's six minutes to ten in the morning. 
* The 0 to 23 System
   Nowadays electronic devices generally use the 0 to 23
   system without the Latin abbreviations but people use both. 
* Examples 
    1. What time does the bus arrive? It arrives at eighteen hundred hours, 18:00
    2. What time does the plane depart? It departs at zero four fifteen, 04:15
    3. What time does the boat leave? It leaves fifteen thiry, 15:30
    4. What time does the subway come in? It comes in twenty-one fifty-four, 21:54
* Without the Half Division
   Nowadays with electronic devices everywhere some people sometimes use a literal
   description of the numbers
* Examples 
    1. What time do you start work? I start at four pm, 4:00 pm
    2. What's the time please? It's four fifteen pm, 4:15 pm
    3. What time did you leave the party? I left the party at three thirty am, 3:30 am
    4. What time are you meeting? I am meeting at nine fifty-five pm, 9:55 pm
* Exercise 4
   1. It's five forty-five. Express it with the traditional system
      (half division and Latin abbreviation).
   2. It's ten to five pm. Express it just by describing the numbers
      without the abbreviation.
* Noon and Midnight
  There are also a specific cases for twelve. A day last 24 hours,
  so 12 is in the middle. Therefore before 12 is the morning and
  after 12 is the afternoon, because 12:00 pm is called noon or midday.
  12:00 am is called midnight (middle of the night).

* Exercise 5

   + 4 long vowels
   + 2 diphthong vowels
