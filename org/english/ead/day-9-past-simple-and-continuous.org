               PAST SIMPLE AND PAST CONTINUOUS!
* Review the verb to be at past tense

  To be is the only irregular verb in past simple tense.

  + I *was* in London last october.
  + You *were* in your native country when you *were* born.
  + That *was* obvious in the previous sentence.
  + You *were* a lot of people to follow my previous lessons.
  + They *were* happy to tell me that last year.

* Regular verbs
 For all the regular verbs you just have to keep the verbal base and
 to add 'ed' at the end. Let's see some examples.

** Examples
   1. I (to work) *worked* yesterday, but fortunately my whife (to
      help) *helped* me a lot.
   2. He (to learn) *learned* English when he was a kid and she (to study)
      *studied* it at University.
   3. I (to try) *tried* to travel as much as possible when I was single.
   4. My daughter (to cry) *cried* yesterday.
   5. Her mother (to cook) *cooked* very well last week and I (to like) *liked*
      that.
** Exercise 1
   Complete the following sentences with the verb in parenthesis using
   the past simple.
   1. I (to plan) to have my breakfast at 7:00 am and now it's 9:00 am.
   2. She (to listen) to the music few minutes ago.
   3. You (to try) to do your exercises yesterday in order to be ok
      with this new lesson.
   4. People in the street usually (to walk) fast when I was in NYC in 2000.
   5. It (to work) when I (to try) this machine two days ago, you (to
      want) to do the same before I (to warn) you yesterday.

* Irregular verbs
  In English there are a lot of irregular verbs. Because of that I've
  decided to do specific lessons on these verbs. So right now I will
  just show you some of them. Don't focus it currently. Be patient
  we'll study them carfully, later.

** Examples  
   1. Yesterday (to go) I *went* to the park.
   2. We (to drink) *drank* some juice this morning.
   3. They (to come) *came* back from their trip in the U.S.A last
      week, they (to spend) *spent* four days with us, and then, they
      (to leave) *left* us for going to New Zealand two days ago.
   4. She (to fall) *fell* in love when she (to meet) *met* him at her
      sister's wedding last year.
   5. You (to cut) *cut* your hair since last month.
** Exercise 2
   1. I (to drink) water last night.
   2. We (to cut) some wood yesterday.
   3. She (to go) to U.K two weeks ago.
   4. They (to come) back from Australia last month, they (to spend) a
      week with us, and then they (to leave) us for going to South
      Africa.
   5. So you (to go) to the cinema with your brother last Wednesday.
* Past continuous

  The construction of the past continuous or past progressive is
  simple: to be (past simple) + verbal base + ing

  Let's see some examples.

** Examples
   1. I (to go) *was going* to show you the past simple before the
      perfect tenses.
   2. You (to read) *were reading* the sentence before this one.
   3. My daughter (to play) *was playing* with her mother while I (to
      write) *was writing* this course.
   4. My nephew (to do) *was doing* a good job with video games during
      Christmas holidays.
   5. They (to live) *were living* living in Russia before we move together.
** Exercise 3
   Complete the following sentences with the verb in parenthesis using
   the past continuous.
   1. I (to eat) my breakfast right now because it's 7:00 am.
   2. Currently, she (to listen) to the music while she (to do) her homework.
   3. Right now, you (to try) to do this exercise in this lesson.
   4. While I (to walk) in the street I can observe people.
   5. After this I (to go) to explain you when you should use one tense
      or another.
