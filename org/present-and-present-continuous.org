#+AUTHOR: Laurent Garnier

* Review the verb to be

  To be is the only irregular verb in present simple tense.

  + I *am* an irregular verb. 
  + You *are* forced to deal with it.
  + That *is* the way it *is*.
  + You *are* not alone.
  + They *are* happy to learn with me.

 for He/She/It where you need to add an 's'. Let's see some examples.

** Examples
   1. I (to work) *work* everyday, but my whife (to do) *does* not.

   5. It (to make) sense to study everyday if you (to want) to improve
      your level.

  The construction of the present continuous or present progressive is
  simple: to be + verbal base + ing

  Let's see some examples.

   5. After this I (to go) to explain you when you should use one tense
